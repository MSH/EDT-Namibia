A SIAPS report on the development of the EDT training package
* Overall SIAPS objectives
* Content was revised based on lessons learned from previous trainings
* Sections of the training package
* Methods:
	SIAPS has collaborated with the UNAM IT department, and begun the process of setting up the EDT training laboratory. 
	The overall objective is to ensure that UNAM, NHTC and MoHSS are equipped to provide 
	pre-service and in-service training on the EDT in a consistent manner. 
	Future EDT trainings will be based on a standardised training package which 
	includes real-life process-based scenarios for active monitoring and 
	management of ART patients and ARVs using the tool. 	
* Conclusion - Standardised way of pre- and in-service training by MoHSS, UNAM and NHTC.

	1. Overall goals and objectives of the training
	2. Training approach
		Highly visual, with live demos on the EDT during the course of the training, 
		practical sessions too based on case studies.
		Results will be measured by completeness of data, e.g. Unique # entry; Analysis of Dispensing practices; [Duplicate patient entries]; 
			Optimal distribution of patients over the months, Number of stock taking done over 12 months; Use of the EDT Mobile; Use of the EDT features;
			Completeness of the Monthly ART report
	3. EDT Processes and how they affect the ART process flow + Core skills to be learnt
	4. EDT Mobile Processes
	Annex A: Case Studies
	Annex B: Job aids and Forms

		ARV Medicine Leaflets with barcodes and three digit codes for dispensing using the EDT Mobile
		ART Monthly Reporting template
	Annex C: Power Point Training Slides and Workbooks
	Annex D: Pre-and-Post Test (Exercise) Sheets
	Annex E: Training programme/schedule
	Annex F: Feedback forms for completion by participants
